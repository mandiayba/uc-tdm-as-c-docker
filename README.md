This component is the workflow for the OpenMinTeD AS-C use case.

## test-data
The test-data folder contains data to run the workflow. More specifically:

```
docker run -i --rm -v $PWD/test-data/:/as-c/data \
 ldeleger/uc-tdm-as-c-docker \

-alias input /as-c/data/corpus/test.xml \
-outputDir /as-c/data/output plans/tag_pubmed.plan
```
